 Excited to unveil my latest machine learning venture: Detecting Parkinson's disease through vocal recordings! 

In this exciting project, I had the opportunity to apply my current machine learning expertise to real-world challenges. 

Machine learning involves predicting and classifying data and to do so we employ various machine learning algorithms according to the dataset.

SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems.

The support vector machine (SVM) model is used here as a predictive model for the prediction of parkinsonâ€™s disease.
